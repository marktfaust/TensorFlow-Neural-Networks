    "For this assignment we will explore Neural Networks; in particular, we are going to explore model complexity. We will use the same dataset from Assignment #6 to classify a mushroom as either edible ('e') or poisonous ('p'). You are free to use PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn -- to name a few resources. The goal is to explore different model complexities (architectures) before declaring a winner. Either start with a simple network and make it more complex; or start with a complex model and pare it down. Either way, your submission should clearly demonstrate your exploration.\n",
